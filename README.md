# RNN_Snake
A python implemented homemade discrete-time recurrent network, and a homemade game of snake using matplotlib

The RNN was designed from this link: https://snaildove.github.io/2018/06/02/Building+a+Recurrent+Neural+Network+-+Step+by+Step+-+v3/

Game of snake was created from scratch using my knolwedge of the game, implemented with numpy and matplot lib

Snake game is hard to visualize and requires repetive application of showgame(), it was designed to be run through a genetic algorithm (not included, see my account for possible examples)
